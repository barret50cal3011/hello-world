# hello-world
First repository (tutorial)
I am Daniel Barreto, I am 19 years old. 
I started going into programing since there was a talk on my school about how the programers will be the wisards of tomorrow.
Although I wanted to go into programing I did not know how to start.
I started programing at the Computer Science class ofered by my school.
After that I started to program not only for school but in my spare time.

I like music, my favorite genders are rock and metal. 
I specialy like power metal and synphonic metal but I am starting to lissen to Mag√∂ de Oz and I realy like it.
